# Hunts

## Your Role on a Hunt

When your party goes on a hunt or heads out on an expedition, you choose a role from the ones detailed below. Each role can be only chosen by one character, except for the spotter role.

Sometimes the party may split up. When split into groups of two the only roles available are the trailblazer and spotter.

*If someone is alone, they are both the trailblazer and spotter, but they either have to choose to take disadvantage on their survival roll for finding signs or take a -4 to their passive perception.*
