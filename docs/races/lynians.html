Although many of the lynian subspecies originated on the main continent in the Old World many of them have migrated to all corners of the world. For those who stay within multispecies communities, their short stature and beast-like nature has always proved a social hindrance in the lands of the tall folk. While lynians fight for respect within human communities, they can prove themselves through deeds, or humor, among their taller neighbors. They&#x27;ve been seen being farmers, traders, adventurers, etc. Some Lynians, known as &quot;palicos&quot;, are known to assist hunters and quite a few are independent monster hunters, known as prowlers.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lynian-traits">Lynian Traits<a href="#lynian-traits" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lynian Traits" title="Direct link to Lynian Traits">​</a></h3><p>Your lynian character has a variety of natural abilities, honed during their younger years.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</li><li><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> It is currently unknown exactly how old the Lynian people live to be, but they seem to have the average lifespan of most feline species.</li><li><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Lynians are between 2 and 3 feet tall and average about 35 pounds. Your size is Small.</li><li><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You have a cat&#x27;s keen senses, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</li><li><strong><em>Naturally Stealthy.</em></strong> You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.</li><li><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common, Lynian, and one other language of their choice.</li><li><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> Six main subraces of Lynian exist: Boaboa, Felynes, Melynx, Gajalaka, Grimalkyne, and Shakalakas.<br>Choose one of these subraces.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="boaboa">Boaboa<a href="#boaboa" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Boaboa" title="Direct link to Boaboa">​</a></h2><p>Cousins to the shakalaka, the boaboa are one of the few lynians that can tolerate the cold. They call the arctic regions of the world home and strangely enough worship the popo as a god. During the Great Dragon War, the boaboa allied with the Dark Mother when the goliaths and warforged came for the popo’s fur and meat. At the Dark Mother&#x27;s request, the boaboa were tasked with killing their enemies in the most torturous way possible. In return, the Dark Mother promised her protection of the popo. The boaboa excelled at their task, and it wasn&#x27;t until her banishment that they realized her betrayal. The northern sea had been poisoned, filled with the corpses of the goliaths the boaboa had slain. It tainted everything, killing the popo and boaboa alike.</p><p>After the reemergence, the boaboa worship the Wild Lords. It was by their grace that the popo returned to the world. They still have a great hate for the goliaths, just as the goliaths do for them. They&#x27;re slow to trust, but once you earn it, the boaboa can prove to be an invaluable lifelong friend.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="boaboa-traits">Boaboa Traits<a href="#boaboa-traits" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Boaboa Traits" title="Direct link to Boaboa Traits">​</a></h3><p>The Boaboa have the basic shape of a Grimalkyne, but exhibit much thicker, white fur and a bulkier frame. They wear crude imitations of Popo heads as masks, with the tusk&#x27;s tips painted in colours that correspond to the status ailment each individual Boaboa uses in combat.</p><ul><li><p><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Constitution score increases by 1.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Boaboa tends toward neutrality, being more focused on survival than concepts of good and evil. A sense of community can drive boaboas toward lawful alignments.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>Frost Resistance.</em></strong> You have resistance to cold damage.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>Ice Walk.</em></strong> You can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn&#x27;t cost it extra moment.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>Tribal Mask.</em></strong> You have a mask that is a crude imitation of a popo&#x27;s head that has its tusks painted a color. Choose one color from the Popo Mask table. Your boa javelin and your gajalaka tolerance is determined by the color of the mask&#x27;s accents, as shown in the table.<br>

When you hit a creature with it, they take damage as normal, but they must also make a Constitution saving throw.<br>
<!-- -->The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, the creature is afflicted with the condition based on your mask&#x27;s tusk color and lasts for the duration listed in the Popo Mask table.<br>
<!-- -->After you hit a creature with this javelin, the javelin breaks. During a short or long rest, you can create a new javelin, but you can never carry more than one boa javelin at a time.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>Boaboa Tolerance.</em></strong> You have advantage on saving throws against the condition associated with your tribal mask.</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="felyne--melynx">Felyne &amp; Melynx<a href="#felyne--melynx" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Felyne &amp; Melynx" title="Direct link to Felyne &amp; Melynx">​</a></h2><p>The felyne and melynx are the most common lynian subspecies found in the Old World. While both easily adapt to lifestyles with other races taking up jobs as chefs, blacksmith assistants, and other odd jobs, the melynx have a tendency to revert back to their more... wild nature. They are known to occasionally have items of value &quot;appear&quot; in their hands with no knowledge of how they got there. Of course they gladly return the items if asked, but any that go unclaimed are taken to their homes for safekeeping until their owner comes to retrieve them. For those felyne and melynx seeking greater respect, they typically join up with hunters as their palico or as prowlers themselves.</p><p>Felyne and Melynx that live in the wild are looked at as their own culture due to their intelligence, lifestyle, and groups. They are known to form villages in secluded areas, where most monsters wouldn&#x27;t dare to venture to. These villages are known to have tribal exchanges with other lynians and other cultures. They are also known to worship the Wild Lords, with many felyne and melynx druids and rangers originating from these settlements.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="felyne-traits">Felyne Traits<a href="#felyne-traits" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Felyne Traits" title="Direct link to Felyne Traits">​</a></h3><p>Felynes are recognized by their white fur and have the ability to talk in human language, and can be found both in human villages and in the wild.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Charisma score increases by 1.</li><li><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Felynes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are found in villages working as adventurers, chefs, farmers, or traders. Those who tend toward chaos are from the wilderness and live off the land as scavengers and hunters.

They are outlanders much like their shakalaka cousins, but are aggressive towards all monsters and hunters that enter their territory. After the reemergence the few that remained after the war hid themselves away in an attempt to build their numbers back up. It wasn&#x27;t until recent history that the gajalaka showed themselves once more. A gajalaka rarely works with anyone from the civilized world, unless exiled, or if it benefits them. They are also rarely accepted due to many of them being acolytes to the Lord of Murder, necromancers, criminals, or thieves.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="gajalaka-traits">Gajalaka Traits<a href="#gajalaka-traits" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Gajalaka Traits" title="Direct link to Gajalaka Traits">​</a></h3><p>Gajalaka are short humanoids.

They were outlanders, who lived off the land and worked in harmony with nature. They worshiped the Wild Lords and still do to this day.</p><p>The reason the grimalkyne split into the separate tribes of today during the Great Dragon War, was due to a disagreement between its four leaders. Each of them believed they were walking the grimalkyne down the correct path. The Bugtrappers tribe headed into the ancient forests, choosing to seclude themselves like the shakalaka. The Protectors and Troupers tribes joined the other races of the world in the fight against Fatalis and Tiamat. Those grimalkyne who become palicos or prowlers are typically from these two tribes. Finally the Plunderers tribe sought to scavenge the battlefields and other ruins of the world, gathering enough supplies to protect themselves.</p><p>After the reemergence the Bugtrappers remained in the forests as outlanders, hermits, and sages. They assist hunters and provide aid to those who enter their territories. The Protectors and Troupers took their leave, traveling into the deserts and high mountains to build their own communities. Occasionally these tribes have been known to send emissaries to towns, cities, and guilds as a sign of good will. The Plunderers tribe still remain scavengers and criminals. It is not unheard of for a Plunderers tribe grimalkyne to impersonate a Protector or Trouper as a way to enter a town or guild without suspicion.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="grimalkyne-traits">Grimalkyne Traits<a href="#grimalkyne-traits" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Grimalkyne Traits" title="Direct link to Grimalkyne Traits">​</a></h3><p>Grimalkyne resemble bipedal lynxes.

Even before the rise of the ancient civilization the shakalaka had secluded themselves deep in the forests of the world. In doing so, the shakalaka avoided much of the carnage of the Great Dragon War, but also stunted their growth as a society, leaving themselves primitive and barbaric even after the reemergence. Even so, the shakalaka are a proud and barbaric subspecies of lynians, attacking most creatures, including hunters, on sight. Young shakalaka or, Ōme Shakalaka (unripe shakalaka) as they are known in their tribes, have been known to befriend hunters, helping them on their quests.</p><p>Hunters typically encounter these young Shakalaka when they partake in a coming-of-age ritual in which they are sent out of their settlement to bring back items of great value to their tribe. This can take the form of a rare monster material, treasure, or an object with historical or cultural importance to the tribe (such as a special mask).</p><p>Hunters are able to spot an Ōme Shakalaka by their mask. These masks aren&#x27;t the usual telltale orange gourd masks that adult shakalaka wear. Instead young shakalaka wear masks of all varieties, most commonly acorn masks. Shakalaka that become palicos or prowlers are known to have full helms crafted from the creatures they&#x27;ve killed.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="shakalaka-traits">Shakalaka Traits<a href="#shakalaka-traits" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Shakalaka Traits" title="Direct link to Shakalaka Traits">​</a></h3><p>Shakalaka are small, humanoid creatures with green skin.
