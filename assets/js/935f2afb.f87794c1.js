The original dragonborn were known to be humans who had ascended, by the grace of Io, to a state of body and mind that closely resembled the original image of the Five. These dragonborn excelled at all they did, becoming great heroes, community leaders, head of clergies and other research institutions of the ancient civilization. By the end of the Great Dragon War, most of the dragonborn had been wiped out with many of the elder dragonborn bloodlines going extinct with their elder dragon brethren. After the reemergence dragonborns were a rare sight for villages and even some towns. Those that lived in cities were typically well respected noble families that could trace their heritage back to the ancient civilization. New dragonborns that weren\'t born from these families were almost unheard of. It was a rare occasion when a person of any race proved themselves worthy to an Aspect, and were granted the gift as a reward. In Tiamat\'s case, she lorded the ascension over her followers, only granting the gift to those who bring her priceless artifacts, great wealth, or progress her plans beyond her expectations. Those who fail her, or request the ascension, instead are typically turned into kobolds.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"races/dwarves":{"id":"races/dwarves","title":"Dwarves","description":"The bold and hardy dwarves of the Old World are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Modeled by the All-Father after the reemergence almost every dwarf in the Old World originates from Harth, a village near the Everwoods (located west of the Old World). Harth itself still stands as the central heart of dwarven society, but in the last few hundred years they have welcomed the troverians into their home. Combining their crafts, the troverians and dwarves have made a dramatic impact on a hunter\'s quality of life. Mountain and hill dwarves alike can be found in the many cities and locales of the Old World, but typically in small numbers. Hill dwarves are known to make above ground settlements of their own. If drawn to more dangerous pursuits, many dwarves turn to mercenary work, working with the hunters guild and wycademy in search of ancient civilization artifacts.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"races/elves":{"id":"races/elves","title":"Elves","description":"The elves were one of the first races created after the creation of the Old World. They were the first race to be created by Eldath meant to represent the beauty of nature. The elves originated in the wooded lands of the Verdant Hills, and many elves still call the forest their home. After the War of the Ancients, when the elves allied themselves with Eldath against Fatalis and its demonic horde, many of the high elf families did not return to the forest, instead choosing a new life in the city of Riveru. Even after the reemergence, Riveru was a wonderous thing of beauty. Many elven heroes and hunters originate from this city.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"races/humans":{"id":"races/humans","title":"Humans","description":"During the ancient times the human civilizations were widespread across the known world. They are diverse in skills and quick to adapt, which allowed them to learn and live with the other races without conflict. After the reemergence, the humans were recreated by the Aspect Pelor. With the Great Wheel infused with both divine and corruption, the Humans were made stronger, but their once good nature was now shaped by the world around them. Human hunters and folk heroes can originate from anywhere in the Old World and are typically found in all villages, cities, and towns. Most Commonly though, hunters that graduate from the hunter academy are from Minegarde or villages nearby in the Verdant Hills. Humans living in the Verdant hills provide the infrastructure for port and trade between the three largest cities; Dundorma, Verudo, and Riveru; and the rest of the world. As such, humans are typically skilled in some craft, business, or production. For the humans seeking a life away from civilization, more often than not find work with the wycademy or hunters guild as research explorers, archeologist, handlers, or hunters themselves.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"races/race-introduction":{"id":"races/race-introduction","title":"The Races of Monster Hunter","description":"This page contains the flavor text provided by the Guide to Monster Hunting, subsequent pages contain the flavor text provided by the guide as well as any game stats for each race.
